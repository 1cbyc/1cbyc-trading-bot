# 1cbyc Trading Bot

This is going to be a simple trading bot to execute buy and sell with a simple strategy and i will be updating with 
more strategies soon.

## How to Use my Bot

1. Install the dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Replace the Alpaca API credentials in `main.py` with your own. Though I would make an ENV rendering to allow you 
   use that instead.


3. Run the bot:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
