## 🔍 Common Questions & Answers

### Technical Questions
**Q: Why did you choose process-based over threading?**
A: Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limits true parallel execution with threads. Processes provide true parallelism, better isolation, and crash recovery.

**Q: How do you handle MT5 connection failures?**
A: Automatic reconnection logic with exponential backoff, comprehensive error logging, and graceful degradation.

**Q: What's the difference between demo and real trading?**
A: Identical functionality but complete environment isolation. Real trading requires explicit confirmation and has enhanced safety measures.

### Security Questions
**Q: How do you protect trading credentials?**
A: All credentials are in .env files that are gitignored. Process isolation prevents cross-contamination between environments.

**Q: What happens if the bot crashes?**
A: Process isolation means crashes are contained. The bot manager can restart failed processes automatically.

### Performance Questions
**Q: How do you measure trading performance?**
A: Win rate, profit factor, drawdown, and Sharpe ratio are tracked. Real-time monitoring via web interface.

**Q: Can the bot handle multiple symbols?**
A: Yes, the architecture supports multiple symbols with position management and risk controls per symbol.
